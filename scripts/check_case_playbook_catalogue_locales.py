"""A new case playbook must not silently un-finish a finished language.

Case playbooks live in ``frontend/src/features/cases/data/*.playbook.ts``. Each
one names its catalogue strings by key and carries the English inline as a
``*Default`` field, so English renders correctly the moment the file lands and
nothing looks wrong locally. Every other language renders that English instead,
and only in that language, which is why this went unnoticed: the person adding
the playbook is not the person who sees the gap.

That is what happened. One commit added thirty eight playbooks and touched no
locale file at all. The titles and descriptions arrived a day later in a batch
pass whose commit message described a different screen entirely, and the longer
text never arrived. Four of the languages affected had been complete before that
commit.

So this gate does not ask for every language. Requiring thirty one translations
before a playbook may land would stop the case library growing, and the library
growing is the point. It asks only that the languages which are *already*
finished stay finished. Those are listed in REFERENCE_LOCALES below, and the
list is meant to grow: when a language reaches full catalogue coverage, add it
here and it can never quietly regress afterwards.

Scope is the catalogue only, meaning the title, the one line description and the
long description. Those are what a reader sees in the case list before opening
anything. Step level text is a much larger body of work and is deliberately not
gated here, because a gate nobody can satisfy gets switched off.

``longdesc`` is required only where English actually has one. Eighty two of the
playbooks have no ``longDescKey`` at all, which is a gap in the English copy
rather than in any translation, and asking a translator to supply what was never
written would send them looking for a field that does not exist.
