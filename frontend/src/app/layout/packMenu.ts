/**
 * Menu focus for packs that bring their own frame of modules.
 *
 * Choosing a framework pack (for example the eleven-area project frame) puts
 * that frame at the centre of the work, so the sidebar narrows to it: the
 * pack's own modules and our core modules (cost databases, estimates, the
 * takeoff and BIM tools and a few companions) stay, and every other row steps
 * out. The modules stay installed. Nothing new is stored: the rows are written
 * into the same per-user list the "Edit menu" editor uses (`useHiddenModules`),
 * so showing a row again in the editor is the only way back and that choice
 * persists like any other. Only rows the editor itself can hide are touched,
 * never whole sections and never the structural rows (dashboard, projects,
 * settings, users, about).
 *
 * One marker entry per pack (`pack:<slug>`) lives in the same list and records
 * that the pack has already had its say. It is what keeps the editor's choice:
 * with the marker present the pack never hides anything again, even if the
 * user showed every row. The marker is not a route and is never shown or
 * counted as a hidden row.
