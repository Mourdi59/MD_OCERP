// OpenConstructionERP Desktop, Tauri v2 application.
//
// Manages the FastAPI backend as a sidecar process.
// The React frontend loads in a native webview window.
// Backend communicates via http://localhost:{port}/api/
//
// Robustness contract (why this file is defensive):
//   In release builds the process has no console (windows_subsystem = "windows"),
//   so any panic dies silently and, if it happens inside setup(), the window
//   never appears. That is exactly the "I click the icon and nothing happens"
//   failure. So setup() must NEVER panic: every fallible step is handled, the
//   splash window is kept open, a human-readable error is shown via setError(),
//   and a full diagnostic log is always written to
//   ~/.openestimate/desktop-launcher.log (alongside the backend's own data).
