The snapshot map used to be a literal table next to the endpoint that reads it.
When the data repo nested every market under a common folder, the parquet map
moved with it because it is derived, and the snapshot table did not, so all
thirteen of its entries named files that no longer existed and every restore
returned a download error. These tests hold the two maps to the same source.
