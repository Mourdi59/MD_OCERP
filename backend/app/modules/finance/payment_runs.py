"""Payment runs - pure, dependency-free rules.

A payment run is the accounting team's weekly "what do we pay on Friday": the
approved supplier invoices of one legal entity, in one currency, that fall due
by a date, each with the amount to pay on it. A person proposes it, edits it,
approves it and executes it; executing records one ordinary payment per item.

This module holds the decisions and imports nothing from SQLAlchemy or FastAPI,
so they are tested against plain data:

* :func:`propose` picks the invoices. It uses the open balance of
  :mod:`app.modules.finance.ageing` as of the payment date, so an invoice is
  proposed for what is still owed on it, never its full total after a partial
  payment, and retention that is held stays out of the run.
* :func:`check_run` is the validation the service runs before approving and
  again before executing, because invoices change between the two: a payment
  recorded by hand, an invoice cancelled, or the same invoice put in another
  run. Errors block; warnings are shown and do not.
* :func:`bank_csv` writes the remittance list handed to the bank.
