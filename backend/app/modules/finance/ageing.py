"""AR / AP ageing - pure, dependency-free arithmetic.

How much is owed, to or by whom, and how late, per legal entity. Like
:mod:`app.modules.finance.retention_ledger` this module imports nothing from
SQLAlchemy or FastAPI, so the definitions below are tested against plain data.

**The open balance of an invoice, as of a cutoff.** The platform had no single
definition: the dashboard counts every unpaid invoice at its full total, which
overstates what is owed as soon as one partial payment lands. Here, for an
invoice that is posted and not settled:

* ``cash`` is the sum of its payments dated on or before the cutoff, refunds
  subtracted.
* ``retention`` is the hold-back on it: the larger of the scheduled
  ``retention_amount`` and what payments actually withheld. Holdback is owed
  but not payable until its release date (the lien period, in Ontario), so it
  never ages as overdue. It is reported apart, as *held* until the release
  date on the payment that withheld it and as *released* once that date has
  passed. Scheduled retention that no payment has withheld yet is held.
* ``due`` is ``total - retention - cash``. A negative result is an overpayment
  and is reported as ``credit`` rather than clamped to zero, because a zero
  would print the same line for an exact payment and for a duplicate one.

Posted means ``pending``, ``approved`` or ``sent``. A draft is not yet a claim
on anyone and is counted, not aged; ``paid``, ``cancelled`` and
``credit_note_issued`` are settled. ``paid`` wins over the arithmetic: the
platform marks an invoice paid without requiring a payment row, and an invoice
the accounting team has closed must not reappear as owed.

**Ageing** counts days past the due date; an invoice with no due date falls due
``payment_terms_days`` after its date, or on its date when it has no terms.
Buckets are ``current`` (not past due), ``1_30``, ``31_60``, ``61_90`` and
``over_90``.

Nothing is blended across legal entity, currency or direction: every group and
total is scoped to one (legal entity, currency, direction).
