"""Boot-path data repairs owned by the i18n foundation module.

Imported by :func:`app.core.data_repairs.discover_data_repairs`, which is what
makes the registrations below take effect.

All four repairs here touch ``oe_i18n_tax_config``, and between them they use
every nature the registry has. That is the useful thing about having them side
by side: the tax rate one may not rewrite a value, the two that describe a
rate's scope must, and the reconciler may not write to an existing row at all.

The last two are also the same defect seen from its two ends.
``v3302_tax_combination`` backfilled ``combination`` on thirteen Canadian and
United States rows, and that backfill never runs on the boot path, so an
upgraded install has all thirteen sitting on the column's server default. Eleven
of them are sub-national and are repaired by the subdivision entry, which has to
write ``combination`` anyway to satisfy the table's check constraint - ten
``(country, tax_code)`` pairs, one of which matches two rows because Nova Scotia
ships its superseded 14 % rate as well. The other two are the country-wide
federal layers, they break no constraint, and nothing reached them at all until
``tax_federal_scope`` was added.

``tax_seed_reconcile`` is a different defect that lands on the same table and it
is worth not confusing them. The three above repair rows that are here and say
the wrong thing. That one is about rows that are not here at all, because the
seeder fills the table only while it is empty and the shipped file has grown
eleven rates since. Eight of them are Canadian provinces, so an install seeded
before v15.5.0 answers ``subdivision_unknown`` for most of Canada no matter how
completely the three above do their work.

#: Nature ``superseded``: 19 % was the correct Romanian standard rate until
#: 31 July 2025 and the wrong one from 1 August. An estimate or invoice priced
#: before the reform must still resolve at 19 %, so the repair closes the old
#: row's window and inserts the new rate beside it rather than editing the rate
#: in place. The declaration below is what lets the registry's contract test
#: check that, instead of trusting the implementation to have got it right:
#: ``verify_supersede_shape`` fails the repair if any pre-existing row's rate
#: moves, and permits only ``effective_to`` going from empty to set.

#: Nature ``always_wrong``, and worth saying why, because it writes to the same
#: table as the repair above and does the thing that one is forbidden to do: it
#: edits a pre-existing row in place. The difference is which column. These rows
#: were seeded without the subdivision they apply in - a Canadian provincial
#: rate that names no province is not a rate that was correct until some date,
#: it is a row that was incomplete from the day it was written. Nothing was
#: entitled to resolve against it, and filling the label in is not a change of
#: value. The rate itself is never touched.

    )
)

#: Nature ``always_wrong`` again, and the argument is the one above with the
#: axis turned around. These two rows say ``national`` because that is the
#: server default the boot heal left on them, not because anybody decided they
#: were country-wide-and-nothing-else; ``combination`` did not exist when they
#: were written and nothing read it until the resolver did, so no document was
#: ever priced against the distinction and there is no date at which
#: ``national`` was the right answer. Correcting it in place is the whole
#: repair, and it is deliberately not ``superseded``: closing a window and
#: inserting a second Canadian GST row beside the first would give the country
#: two federal layers, which is a worse database than the one being repaired.
#:
#: Separate from the subdivision entry rather than folded into it because the
#: two have different predicates and different failure modes. That one writes
#: two columns together to satisfy a check constraint and skips a row that
#: already carries a subdivision; this one writes one column on a row that has
#: no subdivision and never will.

)

#: Nature ``never_delivered``, and the only entry here that corrects nothing.
#: Every row it writes is one this database has never held, because the seeder
#: fills ``oe_i18n_tax_config`` only while it is empty and the shipped file has
#: grown since this install was built. So there is no value to preserve, no
#: window to close, and the whole safety question moves to a different place:
#: proving that a row which is not there was never delivered rather than
#: deleted. The repair's own module is where that argument lives, and
#: ``NeverDelivered`` is what holds it to the only shape that argument permits,
#: which is to add and touch nothing.
#:
#: ``identified_by`` is country plus tax code because that is what a reader of
#: this table treats as one answer. The failure an additive repair really has
#: is not damaging a row but doubling it, and a second Ontario HST row beside
#: the customer's own is worse than the missing rate this exists to deliver.
#: The revision is empty because there is no revision: no schema change caused
#: this and no ``upgrade()`` body would have fixed it.
