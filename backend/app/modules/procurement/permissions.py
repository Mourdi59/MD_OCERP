        ``procurement.create_invoice`` is split off from the generic
        ``procurement.create`` permission and pinned to MANAGER. The
        PO → Invoice conversion crosses into the finance module and
        creates a payable that bypasses the normal invoice approval
        chain - EDITORs can still draft POs and goods receipts, but
        only MANAGER+ may turn one into a vendor invoice (which is a
        binding financial commitment downstream).
