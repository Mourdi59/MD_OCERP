"""Background job handlers for onboarding provisioning.

Wrap the two heavy first-run operations - regional cost base import and sample
project install - as JobRun handlers so the wizard can fire them and move on.
Both underlying operations are already idempotent (they early-return when the
data is already present), and both are wrapped fail-soft here: a first-run new
user must never see the wizard break because an optional cost base could not be
downloaded. Progress is reported through ``update_progress`` so the client's
polling banner can show a real bar rather than a fake ramp.

Heavy imports (``costs.router``, ``demo_projects``) are done lazily inside the
handlers, not at module load, so registering these handlers at startup stays
cheap and free of import cycles.
